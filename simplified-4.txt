Amazon workers in Germany, Spain, Italy, and the U.K. went on strike on Black Friday.
“They are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances.
People with kids, homes, bills to pay — they’re not robots.
According to the Business Insider around 1,600 employees participated in the walkout at Spain’s largest Amazon warehouse in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid, and will continue to strike on Saturday.
“The conditions our members at Amazon are working under are frankly inhuman,” said a statement by GMB General Secretary Tim Roache.
Jeff Bezos is the richest bloke on the planet; he can afford to sort this out.”

Amazon announced last month that it would raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour in the U.S., however, it eliminated several financial perks.

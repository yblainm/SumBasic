Amazon workers in Germany, Spain, Italy, and the U.K. went on strike on Black Friday.
GMB claims that ambulances have been called 600 times to Amazon warehouses in the past three years to attend to worker injuries.
A statement from British union GMB said hundreds were expected to strike at five locations across the U.K. to protest “inhuman conditions” at Amazon warehouses.
“We’re standing up and saying enough is enough.
These are people making Amazon its money.
“They are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances.

The legislation, known as Bill C-89, was sent to the Senate early Saturday after the Liberals pushed it through the House of Commons in a special sitting that lasted until the wee hours of the morning.
Sen. Peter Harder, the Government Representative in the Senate, said in a statement that he was pleased the bill had moved forward, “particularly given the holiday season.”

But he added that senators wanted more time to consider witness testimony, as well as whether the legislation complies with the charter.
The bill would appoint a mediator-arbitrator to help Canada Post and the union representing its workers come to an agreement.

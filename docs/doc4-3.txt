Amazon workers in Germany, Spain, Italy, and the U.K. went on strike on Black Friday.

According to the Business Insider around 1,600 employees participated in the walkout at Spain’s largest Amazon warehouse in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid, and will continue to strike on Saturday.

A statement from British union GMB said hundreds were expected to strike at five locations across the U.K. to protest “inhuman conditions” at Amazon warehouses. GMB claims that ambulances have been called 600 times to Amazon warehouses in the past three years to attend to worker injuries.

“The conditions our members at Amazon are working under are frankly inhuman,” said a statement by GMB General Secretary Tim Roache. “They are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances.

“We’re standing up and saying enough is enough. These are people making Amazon its money. People with kids, homes, bills to pay — they’re not robots. Jeff Bezos is the richest bloke on the planet; he can afford to sort this out.”

Amazon announced last month that it would raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour in the U.S., however, it eliminated several financial perks.

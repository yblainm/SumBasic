As with long months spent trying to figure out how to pull Northern Ireland out of the EU without creating a customs border with the Republic, the Gibraltar dispute has reflected problems with the UK’s European neighbours dating back to its imperial past.
The Gibraltar agreement with Spain provided a reminder of the complexities that Britons have found since voting narrowly in a 2016 referendum to try to unravel 45 years of membership of what is now the world’s biggest free trade bloc.
EU officials are unclear what might happen if parliament rejects the package and, like London, are making arrangements to manage the disruption of Britain crashing out without a deal.
The party, along with many of Ms May’s Conservatives and the Labour opposition, are all threatening to vote down the package.
DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the withdrawal agreement would leave Britain in a “pitiful and pathetic place ... locked into an EU straitjacket”.
But, keeping up pressure within her own Conservative party, her Brexit-supporting rival and former foreign minister Boris Johnson called on Saturday for the accord to be renegotiated.
“And I believe that we have finally found the best possible compromise.”

That is also how Ms May is trying to present her deal.
“We were all looking for a good and fair agreement,” Mr Tusk said in a letter on Saturday to the 27 other national leaders confirming the summit will go ahead.
She will face an uphill struggle to have the agreement accepted by her own party and the British parliament.
After little more than an hour of talks among themselves, the 27 EU leaders will meet at about 11am to share with Ms May two key documents - a treaty setting terms for an orderly British withdrawal on March 29th, and an outline of how Britain can keep close to its biggest market by following some EU rules after a status-quo transition period ends in two to four years.
